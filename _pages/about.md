Welcome to the DAIR Group!
We are part of the [Center of Machine Learning Research (CMLR)](https://cmlr.pku.edu.cn/){: target="_blank"} at [Peking University (PKU)](https://www.pku.edu.cn/){: target="_blank"}. 
Together we enjoy working on **Data-centric Machine Learning**, **Graph Machine Learning**, 
**Machine Learning Systems**, and **Interdisciplinary Applications**.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

We are...(open positions)
